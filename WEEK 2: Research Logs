Technical writing is practical. There's a lot of hands such as a computer. There isn't much of a pencil or paper use. Theres a lot of computer based technolgy that is used for this type of writing. We aree Starting out with our first project which is a fanzine and coustomize a video on "How to do."
We also used legos to build something and make a powerpoint as How to build this. 
I would've added more clear explaination for my lego project because when i showed it to my class mate, it wasnt really clear but she was able to have a better understanding with the pictures that i posted.
Setting up this account was very new to me. I have never heard from it and I'm still getting use to it and seeing how everything works.
This week I learned more about what a fanzine is and getting familiar with the technology thats going on in the class.
